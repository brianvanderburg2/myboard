Particular use cases

    Create the board object:
 
        $board = new MyBoard\Board($config)

    Run the board (entry.php or whatever)

        $board->execute()

    Show user information or login/logout (can put on any page if desired)

        $board->user->isLoggedIn()
        $board->user->login($username, $password)

    Show comments for a section of a page

        Solution 1:
            Use JSON/Ajax to pull comments in

        Solution 2:
            Just link to a specific topic on the board created for
            comments.

    Use templates from the board (note all templates will
        get certain initial varialbes, mainly $board, and always $template)

        $myboard->template->get('name', $params)

    Use captcha from board

        Redirect to:

            entry.php/captcha/prompt/<keyname>/return=

        Afterward:

            $key = $myboard->captcha->new()
            $myboard->captcha->embed($key)

                (for image captchas, this will create an image element that links back to
                entry.php/captcha/<key>[/params] which will call $myboard->captcha->display($key, $params)

            $myboard->captcha->verify($key, $userentry)


Pages
    index /index
    portal /portal
    view forums /forum[/<fid>[/<seo>]
    view topic /topic/<tid>[/<seo>]
    new topic /newtopic/<fid>
    new post /newpost/<tid>
    edit post (mod action only) /editpost/<pid>
    login /login
    logout /logout (show a logout page)
    logout /logout/<key> (direct logout without token)
    userpage /userpage/<uid|username>[/<page>]

    GET parameters will control some items:  For instance:

    /userpage/admin?action=edit
    /userpage/admin/page2?action=edit
    /userpage/admin?action=new
    /userpage/admin/page2?action=delete


Configuration
    The configuration is what is passed in initially to the board application.
    This is used to get the application up and running.

    userdata.dir - REQUIRED - The path to the user data directory, that is the
        data that is created or customized by the end user)
    userdata.method - REQUIRED -  The method to use to send files from the user
        data directory.  If not specified, url is assumed.
        url (use a public URL prefix)
        direct (directly send the file from the PHP code (slow, should not use)
        apache-xsendfile
        apache-xsendfile2
        lighttd-xsendfile
        nginx-xaccelredirect (url is used as the prefix)
    userdata.url
        method=url, the URL prefix for user data, written directly to HTML
        method=others (url is written as entry.php/data/(public/user/...)
        method=nginx-xaccelredirect, the prefix to use for nginx x-accel-redirect
    # appdata.dir - Does not exist, inferred by the application
    appdata.method - Same as userdata.method, except for the application data
    appdata.url - Same as userdata.url, except for the application data
    admin.key - HASH of admin master key, or an array of hashes.  This is used to "login"
        to the board for administrative purposes.  Such a user can't create posts (since this
        key doesn't mean the user has a corresponding user id) directly from this key.  It is
        possible to log in as a user as well as a master admin.
    database.host (host of database)
    database.port (port of database)
    database.socket (socket of database, do not use with host/port)
    database.name (name of database to use)
    database.user (username to use when connecting)
    database.pass (password to use when connecting)
    database.prefix (prefix used for all tables)
